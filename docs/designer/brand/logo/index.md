World Vision has only one logo. No other logo or graphic mark may be used to advertise, market, or communicate a World Vision product or project.

All of the graphic elements (horizon, logotype, cross/star, white background, and registration mark) must always be shown together as displayed here. None of the constituent elements of the logo may be shown separately in any context.

The logo must always be shown on a white background.

The World Vision logo must always be reproduced from the original .eps vector or original .jpg bitmap artwork. Never recreate the World Vision logo.



### Logo use

The World Vision logo usage must be in compliance with the WVI Corporate Identity Standards. Online usage of the corporate logo should align with “best practice” conventions to appear in the upper left corner of the page with the horizontal tagline “lock-up.”

When the World Vision logo is used on external sites, the logo should always link to worldvision.org.

Use these measurements to ensure adequate protected space between the logo and any surrounding text or images.
